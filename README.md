# Dnd5e

## Subclasses

class.ts issue fixed: property starting_equipiment corrected to starting_equipment.

Nothing significant was changed in spells.service.ts nor in subclass.ts. The linter made them more consistent with the rest of the project.

Subclass component initiated. Subclass component content is displayed within the class-info component. Subclass service was not initiated in favour of the async pipe in subclass.component.html.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
